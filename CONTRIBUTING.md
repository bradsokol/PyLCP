Contributing to PyLCP
=====================

If you have an idea to make this library more useful for other LCP App developers, we
welcome your contributions. Here is a rough guide for a process to follow:

* Be sure you're familiar with existing API so that your proposed change is consistent
with current features. The [LCP Reference
Manual](http://points.github.io/Loyalty-Commerce-Platform/?doc=reference-manual) and [LCP API
Reference](http://points.github.io/Loyalty-Commerce-Platform/?doc=api-reference) are good
documents to read.

* Write tests as needed. Run `nosetests` to confirm that all tests passed and that
code coverage is the same or higher.

* We use PEP8 as our code style standard with one change for line length. You
must run `flake8` to ensure that your changes follow this standard.

* Don't bump version_number.txt

* Submit your changes in a pull request.
